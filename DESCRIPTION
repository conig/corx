Description: Create correlation (or partial correlation) matrices. Correlation matrices are formatted with significance stars based on user preferences. Matrices of coefficients, p-values, and number of pairwise observations are returned. Send resultant formatted matrices to the clipboard to be pasted into excel and other programs. A plot method allows users to visualize correlation matrices created with 'corx'.
