\usage{
plot_mds(corx, k = NULL, abs = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{corx}{the corx object, or a matrix of correlation coefficients}

\item{k}{a numeric, the number of clusters. If set to "auto" will be equal to the number of principal components that explain more than 5\% of total variance.}

\item{abs}{if TRUE (the default) negative correlations will be turned positive. This means items with high negative correlations will be treated as highly similar.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to ggpubr::ggscatter}
}
\description{
plot the Classical multidimensional scaling of a corx object
}
\details{
plot_mds performs classic multidimensional scaling on a correlation matrix. The correlation matrix is first converted to a distance matrix using psych::cor2dist.
This function employs the following formula:
\deqn{d = \sqrt(2*(1-r))}
These distances are then passed to stats::cmdscale where k = 2. To compute \eqn{latex}{R^2}, distances are predict from the cmdscale output and correlated with input distances. This correlation is squared.
 If the value of \eqn{R^2} is less than 70%, a warning will inform users that two-dimensions may not be sufficient to represent item relationships.
 The position of variables is then plotted with ggplot2. Clusters of items are identified using stats::kmeans. The number of clusters is determined using principal component analysis unless specified.
